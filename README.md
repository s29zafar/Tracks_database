# Tracks_database
This is a simple project to understand the basics of a database.
The project has three components:

1) Database - Download sqlite from here -> https://sqlitebrowser.org, And create your own database.

2) XML file - contains sample data to be used if the user does not have any other musical data to 
be converted to a database.

3) Python file - DB_tracks: this is used to connect the XML file and the database. The program takes
data from the XML file and inserts it into the database using inbuilt python functions.
